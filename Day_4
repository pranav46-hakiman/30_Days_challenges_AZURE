2. Management Virtual Networks (HUB):

2.1. Creating a Virtual Network Manager:
Steps:
Step 1: You can search Virtual Netwrok Manager in Search bar in the home page.
Step 2: Click on to "CREATE".
Step 3: Enter the necessary details:
      -> First create a new "RESOURCE GROUP".
      -> Network Manager name.
      -> Region.
      -> Features.
Step 3: Choose both the feature "CONNECTIVITY & SECURITY ADMIN":
Step 4: Choose the scope [FREE TRIAL] in the next page and go to "REVIEW+CREATE".
Step 5: Click on "CREATE". Then go to the resource to view your Virtual Network Manager.


2.2. Creating Virtual Networks:
Step 6: Now you need to create some Vnets based on your requirment and choose the same resource group which you used it for Network Manager. 
Step 7: Give different IP addresss fot each Vnet so it doesn't overlap and add tags if you want to.


2.3. Creating Virtual Network Gateway:
Step 8: You can search Virtual Netwrok Gateway in Search bar in the home page.
Step 9: Click on to "CREATE".
Step 10: Enter the necessary details:

      -> Virtual Network
      -> Region
      -> VPN type
      -> SKU
      -> Generatio: either 1 (or) 2.
      -> Publib IP address name
Step 11: Go to "REVIEW+CREATE". Then, click on "CREATE".
Step 12: Once depolyment is complete, go to the resource to view your Virtual Network Gateway.



2.4. Creating Network Groups in the Network Manager:
Step 13: Now go to the Network Manager resource, click on "NETWORK GROUP" in the settings for Network group creation.
Step 14: Enter the name and select the member type as "VIRTUAL NETWORK". Then, click on "Create".
Step 15: When you go into the the NETWORK GROUP you created, click on add Vnets to add members manually.

Step 7: Once deployment is complete, you can click on go to resource to view the Virtual Machine.

NOW,
Step 8: Go to NETWORKING in the VMs settings.
Step 9: Click on the "NETWORK INTERFACE CARD" and go to "HELP" to view the "EFFECTIVE ROUTES"
--------This VM is inside the HUB.
Step 10: Go to the Vnet which you choosed it as HUB.
